            Research has consistently shown that the synchronization of music with repetitive exercise provides enhanced physical 
            performance, helping people both work out for longer and train more efficiently. In one study, participants who cycled 
            in time to music found that they required 7 percent less oxygen compared to cycling with background (asynchronous) music. 
            In other words, music provides temporal cues that have the potential to make more efficient use of physical energy.

        A 2011 study conducted at the University of Groningen showed that music not only affects mood, 
        but it has an even more significant effect on perception. Subjects who were tested were influenced 
        by the music they heard, based on what they saw; participants were asked to listen to music and identify 
        corresponding smiley faces. Smiley faces that matched the music were identified much more accurately. 
        And even when no smiley face was shown, the subjects thought they recognized a happy face when listening 
        to happy music, and a sad face when listening to sad music.
